End at the same point we have Washington technologies along the way. I would argue that awareness of chemistry is at an all-time low. We no longer even do actual chemistry experiments in high school progress, cheap sugar, cheap sugar.

The announcement of the state department purchasing armored. Teslas has made me wonder about their vulnerabilities.   One of the characteristics of anything Elon makes is a delightful aspect of their technology.

A Tesla cyber truck is an enormously heavy vehicle. I know this because while protesting at our local test with Dealer, I watched a dead cyber truck shut down the entire parking flow area for the Tesla dealership when they couldn't get it started. It was essentially a giant Rock sitting in the middle of everything, too heavy to be moved. My thinking is a bunch of part of epoxy glue poured into the charging port on a Tesla cyber truck means you won't be able to charge it unless it becomes a rock.
