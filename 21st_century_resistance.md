# 21st Century Resistance

In my essay / short story "The Way It All Ended", I contemplate what a modern resistance effort based on 21st century technologies might look like.  And that brings us to this essay where I'm going to lay out why I thought the way I did.

## War and Technology

Any war is always fought with variations on the technology of the day.  Man fought other man with rocks and sticks in close quarter combat until things like bows and arrows allowed distance based combat.  Similarly the [atlatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear-thrower) introduced distance combat to earlier cultures (bows and arrows require both string and laminated wood so a bow and arrow requires a greater technological base).  And we have seen this throughout all recorded history -- new technology is always used in a combat situation:

* The new metal working factories in Britain led to the [Sten Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten) being the dominant weapon for years
* The advent of cheap alarm clocks let IRA fighters leave bombs through out Northern Ireland in the time of the troubles

## Asymmetric Warfare 

It is important to note that what I am discussing here is asymmetric warfare.  Here's a definition:

Asymmetric warfare, also known as irregular warfare, is a type of conflict where one side, often a non-state actor, uses unconventional tactics and strategies to counter a more powerful, conventional military force.

It is important to understand that what is facing us isn't traditional warfare.  We can't win a straight up fight.  What we can do, however, is fight differently and fight smarter.

## What's Different About Now?

And that brings us to today.  What is different about today's technology which will lead to new and innovative mechanisms of combat?  Here are some of the changes I see:

* 3D printing 
* Drones
* Software is everywhere
* GPS is ubiquitous 
* WiFi is everywhere 
* Rechargeable Power Tools
* Adaptable Consumer Technology
* Swimming Pools

### 3D Printing

3D printers are everywhere.  I have a dozen upstairs.  Not only can 3d printers be used for prototyping of virtually any manufactured object, they can also be used for producing actual weapons:

* 3D printed hand guns should be able to evade metal detectors
* 3D printed combat knives, if done in ABS instead of PLA, would be excellent stealth weapons

### Drones

As we've seen in Ukraine, drones are ubiquitous.  Not only can drones provide a safe surveillance tool, they can actually be used as effective weapons of war:

* Grenade dropping from drones
* Pamphlet dropping from drones
* Chasing vehicles down with a drone to induce a driver to crash

With a range of several kilometers, a drone pilot doesn't need to be anywhere near the combat zone. 

It is interesting to note that the drone accessories to allow a commercial drone to operate as a weapon of war are now [commercially available in the U.S.](https://www.wired.com/story/drone-accessories-weapons-of-war/)

### Software is Everywhere

An aspect of war that has not yet been exploited is that the entire military runs on software.  In a modern military it takes between 3 to 6 support staff to support a combat fighter.  And those support staff do their jobs via software -- everything from web forms to search tools to databases, without that technology, they can't support a fighter.  Imagine a hacking army that focused on disabling online logistics resources so that combat fighters weren't resupplied.  It is said that an army marches on its stomach.  Think about what happens when that army's food resources are redirected a hundred miles south.  Or their ammunition supplies.

### GPS is Ubiquitous 

GPS is everywhere in modern society.  And the corollary to GPS is that people don't work well with traditional maps or actually have a good understanding of geography.  I suspect we are going to see GPS jamming become a thing as a deliberate way to prevent soldiers from reaching their destinations.

And, yes, I get that soldiers are trained to read maps.  However GPS jamming will give "cover" to soldiers who sympathize with the resistance.  "I don't know Sarge, I think we are in the right place but the GPS failed and I had to do it manually.  Maybe I got it wrong"

### WiFi is Everywhere 

WiFi has become an enabling technology that drives **everything**.  Expect to see old WiFi access points that feature SDR (software defined radio) technology repurposed into WiFi jammers to wreak havoc with connectivity and demoralize troops.

### Rechargeable Power Tools

Traditional power tools are corded and noisy.  Rechargeable power tools can be used anywhere and can be close to silent.  What happens when people use those tools to:

* Drill holes in gas tanks of military vehicles
* Drill holes in tires that are too large to patch
* Use electric chainsaws to drop trees in the way of combat vehicles

### Adaptable Consumer Technology

America has an astonishingly vast pool of technology that could be adapted to an urban warfare context:

* An electric go kart could be a silent weapons delivery platform if the approach pathway was straight to the target
* Instant pots have been sold by the millions if not tens of millions.  Any pressure cooker is a bomb waiting to be made.

### Swimming Pools

You wouldn't think that swimming pools could ever pose a threat, would you?  Well you can't have swimming pools without chlorine which is an incredibly toxic substance that can easily be weaponized.

### Sidebar: I Ignored Chemistry

It should be noted that with the exception of chlorine, I largely ignored chemistry as a tool of war.  I simply lack this specific expertise.  A chemist or materials science expert really needs to contribute here to point out viable exothermic chemical reactions that can be achieved with off the shelf materials.

## Conclusion

Given the scope of the U.S. economy and the way that existing technologies can be repurposed to war fighting, it is hard to envision a world where the needed tools aren't available to us.  What will the Trump administration do?  Shut down all the swimming pools in the country?  Make pressure cookers illegal?  Given that we can't win a straight up fight, asymmetric warfare is the logical path forward.
