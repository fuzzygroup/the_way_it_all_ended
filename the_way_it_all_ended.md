# The Way It All Ended

I was there when it all ended. It was real. I helped.  I did my part.  And I bet you did too.  We all did.  And we took down the President, the richest man in human history and the rest of their traitorous cabal.

You'd like to think that bringing down a government is a matter of an elite core of military or CIA trained assassins but it just wasn't that simple. That's fiction.  Real life is messy.  This was when people rose up and took back their government.

Looking back at this with the perspective of time, I can see that there were three stages to all of it.  It began with the protests, raised its tenor with small acts of civil disobedience / subversion and then came the violence.  And the violence wasn't what anyone thought.  In many ways it felt a lot like Ukraine -- Russia should have simply rolled over Ukraine but they didn't.  And, similarly, the U.S. military should have rolled over the resistance but they didn't.

My first awareness of the protests was when I started to see messaging from **50501**.  This was a decentralized network of protests using the slogan 50 states, 50 capitals, 1 day.  Born out of a Reddit post, I'm proud to say that I was there on February 5th in Indianapolis as the first protest I ever went to in my life.  The 50501 protests grew over time.  February 5th led to February 17th and that led to the start of economic push backs like February 28th Buy Nothing day and so on.  

## Civil Disobedience Leading to Acts of Subversion

I very fondly remember my introduction to civil disobedience.  My wife and I became convinced that Elon Musk was at the heart of everything.  As we researched, I ran into the slogan "Don't Buy a Swasticar" and the activists in London that were putting stickers on Teslas.  I stole the artwork from a picture I saw in the Guardian.  My wife cleaned it up and had StickerMule send us several hundred.  And then I went to my local supermarket  armed with a handful.  I peeled the back off the sticker sitting in my car and as I walked past a white Model X, I stealthily slapped it on the bumper.  That was a rush.

Small acts of civil disobedience escalated nationwide often with Elon Musk and Tesla as the focus.  While most people couldn't get near Donald Trump, there were Tesla dealerships and Super Charging stations nationwide.  Here were some of the acts of disobedience that became common:

* Tesla signs started to have swastikas painted on them.  
* Tesla cars got stickers pasted on them.  
* Tesla Super Chargers got vandalized ranging from stickers put on them to swastikas painted on them to cutting the cables to make them unusable. 
* If you saw a Tesla on the road, people gave it the finger.  
* People made appointments for test drives in Teslas and left raw shrimp in the air vents (this, days later, causes an awful smell).  
* Tesla workers would show up at the dealerships and find the doors chained shut.  
* My personal favorite were the merry prankstesr who put fart spray on the handles of Super Chargers.  
* The term Wank Panzer became common online.  
* CyberTrucks aka the Wank Panzer became popular graffiti targets.  

And it should be known that it wasn't just Tesla.  Trump properties were affected by all this. people began peeing on the side of Trump Tower properties nationwide.  Litter started getting thrown at Mar-A-Lago.

Other facilities of Elon Musk also came under attack using fart spray.  Using nothing more than YouTube drone tours of Elon Musk's StarLink facilities in Bastrop Texas, air vents were identified and glass vials of fart spray were dropped right into the air vent.  Given that modern drones, even cheap consumer models, can now travel kilometers, this happened regularly.  Drones also dropped vials of skunk essence (hey he is Elon **Musk**) into the tunnel that people used to walk under the highway separating different buildings at this facility.  

There was the NBTP or new Boston tea party, a group of hackers out of MIT, which took control of Teslas remotely and drove them into the harbor in a massive act of protest.

And who would have ever thought that a bunch of senior citizen ladies, who organized peaceful sit ins outside the homes of Governors, Senators and Congress Critters would have been tossing seed "bombs" (really just envelopes of seeds) over the fences of the properties they sat outside.  Now you might think that this was innocent but any gardener knows that poison ivy just **spreads** and **mint** shudder.  This, like all the other myriad tiny acts of subversion, all worked to raise tension in America towards the breaking point.  The goal was never to provoke anything specific but to make the people in power feel as unhinged as the Trump regime had made everyone on the left feel.

Anyone who has ever had poison ivy knows how it makes you feel.  Imagine a government full of senior staff itchy and scratching.  

## The Violence

The violence started with an attempted ICE arrest in Brooklyn in a largely Mexican neighborhood.  A squad of ICE agents showed up and the people had had enough.  Kristi Noem was there herself and the first bit of thrown fruit hit her smack dab in her Barbie like torso.  Canned goods were then thrown at the agents just as they were thrown at the "Patriot Front" in Ohio.  And then shots rang out and 3 Mexican Americans were dead.  The video went viral in moments.  Oh and the person they tried to arrest?  They didn't even have a warrant.  And it turned out that he was an American service man who had served two tours and was waiting on paperwork from the Federal Government.

That was the moment it began.  This was America's Tiananmen Square moment.  Federal agents had just gunned down an American and American Hero at that.  The vibe in America shifted.  While never popular, ICE began to be viewed as Trump's Gestapo.  People began to quietly talk to folks they trusted.  Plans were made.

This wasn't a nationally organized movement. It was a collection of small focused groups with different ideas on how to resist, how to make a statement.  Groups of people came together all over the country mobilizing through Discord, through Signal, through Reddit and just through friends they trusted.

There were a couple of key technologies that made all this possible: Doxing, Drones and just good old fashioned Man Power.  The American Government had become so focused on brutal military technology that it had forgotten how effective tens of thousands of people actually are.  There is a saying that quantity has a quality all its own and it is true.

A doxing group calling themselves Nikola published locations of every single asset that Elon Musk owned.  Every Tesla Dealership, the ridiculous company town, Snailbrook, down in Texas, all the SpaceX facilities, Twitter's data centers, everything.

Another doxing group, this one calling itself Hamilton published the names and home addresses of all the Republican senators, congress people and appointed officials like Steven Miller and Russell Vought.  And the names and home addresses of their parents and their children.

A final doxing group, this one calling itself Carnegie, published the names and home addresses of all the billionaires along with the airports where their private planes land and the boat yards were the big yachts are parked.

With that trifecta of information: Elon's businesses, corrupt government officials and the oligarchs themselves, the revolution had everything it needed.  We had our **targets**.

There were the drone owners who did nothing but hover over the houses of the billionaires, the congressman, and the senators, letting them know that they were being watched. That the eye of the people was upon them.  As Hamilton sang "History Has Its Eyes On You".  Sometimes the drones would even play that music through their speakers.  And still nothing changed.  The crackdowns continued.

By the time all this has happened, Elon Musk had been become widely acknowledged as this country's President and all of his businesses came under attack: Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, Twitter / X / X.ai, SolarCity and TeslaEnergy.  People showed up in droves and using nothing more than sledge hammers and molotov cocktails destroyed every single one of his companies.  Was this fair?  Was this legal?  Well, was DOGE cutting Medicaid by $880 billion fair?  Was cutting SNAP by 20% fair?  The people didn't care anymore -- Trump and Musk had made it clear that the rule of law was dead in America.

Now my personal favorite were the Anti Tesla people.  Since every Tesla dealership was company owned, all the cars were corporate assets.  The Anti Tesla folks were the people who showed up at every Tesla dealership nationwide with nothing more than sledgehammers and simply destroyed all the Tesla inventory. Every car on every lot was destroyed. And every car in every storage lot where Elon had parked all the Teslas that weren't selling.  The very best thing was that since every Tesla dealership was company owned local businesses weren't hurt.  All of the losses came straight out of Elon Musk's bottom line.

I fucking hated Elon Musk and this made me happy.  Now, years later, it still makes me happy.  Elon, who to so many of us was the very personification of Tony Stark, had become Lex Luthor.  

There was the Molotov crew, a group of people who showed up at addresses with nothing more than bottles of gasoline, rags and lighters and burned corrupt individuals out of their homes.  Sometimes warnings were given and sometimes they weren't.  Sometimes people got out and sometimes they didn't.  And, yes, innocent individuals died and I'm sorry for them.

Groups of bicycle thieves across the country took their battery powered grinders that they usually use to cut bike locks and they attacked police parking logs across the country cutting through the tires, two at a time.  Very few police lots had more than a handful of spare tires and these cuts couldn't be patched.  Without their squad cars, the police were largely disabled.  

There were the farmers who took dump trucks of manure and deposited them in front of their representatives homes, in front of the statehouse and in front of every courthouse.

Another group of drone pilots took a very different approach as billionaires and government representatives fled in their cars. This drone crew drove their drones into the car head on and accidents happened all over the country as drives reacted irrationally to a device that couldn't really hurt them. 

There was the electric crew who identified the power lines leading to where the billionaires lived in Austin, in San Francisco and other cities, and simply destroyed the power.  Sometimes this was utility workers who knew what they were doing.  Sometimes it was people who used rifles to shoot out the transformers and the billionaires were literally in the dark.  As a curious side note, since power line transformers take 2 years to build and they are now outsourced to China, those areas remained dark for a long time.  T

There were the plane people who went to all the small private airports, nationwide, and gave every private jet they found flat tires.  No matter how pretty your Gulfstream Jet is, it still needs tires.  And tires can be defeated by a $10 pocket knife.  The fences around the airports?  A $25 pair of wire cutters will get you through a fence.  And hangars aren't particularly secure ... 

There were the boat people who went to marinas all over the country and sank the private yachts of the oligarchs.  All it took was a bunch of cordless drills with long bits drilling holes right at the waterline.  

Trump's deep 50% cut to the military budget left scores of US veterans armed, trained and angry. The VA had been cut hard and the doctors who used to care for them were gone.  So those veterans -- they used guns. They used C4. They used all the training the US military gave them.  And they went to work on the target list hard.

Another crew of drone pilots, the Nordquist collective, took to the skies with with drones, carrying paint balloons and colored the cars of all Republican officials nationwide, hot pink in memory of Sam Nordquist.  This helped all the other groups know who to target.  The Nordquist collective also took on the task of handling congresswoman Nancy Mace.  Nancy Mace had been responsible for stirring up an incredible amount of anti-trans hate in America and, well I'm not gonna describe her fate. It sickened me then, it sickens me now, but I still approve of their actions. 

When the siege of Washington began, a series of truck drivers that previously had transported USAID shipments shut down Washington DC by flooding the streets and interstates.  A continuous convoy prevented tanks and hummers from getting into DC.  When they ran low on fuel, most of the truckers jack knifed their rigs to keep the blockade in place.

And finally the senior staff and the President himself were taken out by a group of women who called themselves "The Handmaids".  The Handmaids with their 3d printed assassination daggers that got through metal detectors by being made of nothing more than ABS plastic and a 10 penny nail epoxied into a groove.  Rumor had it that a number of senior government officials bled out after their genitals were severed.

## Everyone Contributed

Up to this point, I focused on those who engaged in combat, but no revolution is combat alone -- people organized things, people made weapons, people cooked for others, people watched the fighter's children, people did surveillance,  these people, those in the support roles were every bit as important as the ones wielding the weapons.  Just as in traditional combat where there could be as many as 10 to 20 support folk for every fighter, that ratio held true.

And I can't forget the people who read the classic books on resistance and decided to just throw monkey wrenches into the works of government.  While my personal favorite were the people working on the border wall in Texas that added sugar to the concrete mix to prevent it from hardening, these people were everywhere.  It was as if every government worker became a recalcitrant fifth grade boy determined to give his teacher trouble.

## What Came After

In closing I should talk about what came out of that period of chaos.  Yes the bad guys (and they truly were bad guys) got defeated but America came together as a country to figure out how to prevent it from happening again.  There were local town halls, regional caucuses and finally national debates on the all the issues.  Here are a handful of the laws that went into place three months after things settled:

* The Felon47 Act.  An act that stated that no felon could ever be voted into office as a Congress Person, a Senator, Vice President or President.
* The Professional Politicians Get Too Comfortable Act.  An act that set in place term limits to prevent politicians from becoming too comfortable.
* The Civics Exam Act.  An act that ensured that any elected official had to be able to pass a basic civics test -- in public, on video -- after they were elected but before they took office.  If they didn't pass the test, on the first try, the office automatically went to the runner up.  If they didn't pass then the previous administration stayed in office until new elections could be held.
* The Recall of Elected Officials Act -- An act which allowed any elected official to be recalled and a new election held if a 60% majority of voters voted for a recall.
* The Citizens Reunited Act -- An act which repudiated Citizens United to take away corporate spending in political elections.  As the constitution states the government is of the people, by the people and for the people.
* The Its Our Country Act -- An act which limits foreign spending in American elections by penalty of having your assets seized at a rate of 100000x the amount spent. Spend a $100,000 to manipulate an election and you are facing a penalty a million times that amount.  This act was rapidly copied by democracies world wide.
* The Wealth inequality Act. It was decreed that no single individual in America should be wealthier than the smallest of nation states.  This capped personal wealth in America at about $79 million, that of Tuvalu.  People's weath beyond this amount was nationalized with 50% going to address the problems of systemic poverty and 50% being spent to address poverty world wide.  Every year America would pick a country among the 10 poorest in the world and vote on where that surplus went.
* The Bernie Sanders Health Care Is a Human Right Act.  An act which declared that health care was a basic human right and that America needed to join the rest of the industrialized world in providing health care.  This act was named in honor of Bernie Sanders for his brave fighting in Washington.  Clad like a true Vermonter in mittens and a winter hat, Bernie led fighters into the Oval Office.
* The DOGE Lied Act.  While it was now known that DOGE, directed by Elon Musk, had lied repeatedly about government waste, waste was a problem.  The DOGE Lied act allowed citizens to look into government waste.
* The No Permit Required Act.  The protests begun by the 50501 organization marked the start of the movement against Trump and the beginning of his end.  The No Permit Required act removed the requirement for a permit to protest as a recognition of the vital importance of citizen led protests.
* The No More Lies Act.  Recognizing that what put Trump into office was nothing more than his ability to shamelessly lie, the No More Lies act put heavy penalties of 1 million times the amount of the ad spend on the lie -or- the value of the publicity.  Go on Fox News and promote the false claim that "They're eating the cats and dogs in Springfield", well, that air time can be valued and you were going to be fined 1 million times that value.  The kicker in this act is that the funds were paid NOT to the government but to your opposing candidates.  That's right -- get caught in a lie and it made your opponents more successful.
